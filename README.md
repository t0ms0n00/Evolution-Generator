# Evolution-Generator
1st project for OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) course at AGH UST A. D. 2020  

Simulation of a world with one type of animals, which are trying to survive as many days as possible. They can eat, fight for survive and reproduce. We can observe similarities and differences of two independent simulations on two identical maps at the same time. There is a possibility to stop one or both simulations to follow the stats of appointed entity. Map parameters can be configured via proper .json file.
